# This test looks for a few possible problem states with timestamps:
#
# 1. A block with the same timestamp as the parent is invalid
# 2. A block with a timestamp prior to its parent is invalid
# 3. A block with a timestamp one microsecond after its parent is valid
#
# All three conditions come from inequality (49) of the yellow paper
# (https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf, p. 7)
#
# Note that as this test includes blocks that create exceptions, it cannot be
# --filltests on besu currently.
